# How to Start

Starting a journey with a new idea is some time might be difficult if you do not think creatively in the initial phase, so in this section only learn about how to creatively think about a problem or an idea.

According to me creativity only you get by learning multiple things with deep understating. If you want creative thinking first phase is to be a good level of understanding of the terms involved in that idea or problem.

And only things that give you a good idea about these terms are 'learning' and 'doing by yourself'. After applying these techniques I'm sure saying now you are ready to think creatively.

## Starting Phase
1. Choose your field.
2. Learn and do it by yourself, and follow your instructions very well.
3. Try some variation by yourself, it makes you a little bit more creative.
4. Create something you understand, Just do it by yourself, it enhances your skill set.
