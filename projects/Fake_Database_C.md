## Fake Database
A Fake Database is a kind of "structure" or "array" that effectively use a C/C++ program where you made some conceptual rule to add and delete data from the database according to you.

𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚𝐛𝐚𝐬𝐞:

  Index(for searching)
    ↓
    0|-----------|
     |           | ← Data Cell(Contain Data)
    1|-----------|
     |           |
    2|-----------|
     |           |
    3|-----------|
     |           |
    4|-----------|

𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚𝐛𝐚𝐬𝐞 𝐈𝐧𝐬𝐞𝐫𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: Add or insert data to the database.
𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚𝐛𝐚𝐬𝐞 𝐃𝐞𝐥𝐞𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: Remove or Delete data from the database.
```

Now It totally depends on how you can implement this project but one thing keep in mind databases want accuracy and is unambiguous so make sure you think about edge case as well.

Try it with yourself and make a commit of your file with your name field along with the project name in the "project" directory.


<b>Example:</b> <i>suryapratap_fake_database.cpp</i>

> You can implement it with any programming language you are good at.
