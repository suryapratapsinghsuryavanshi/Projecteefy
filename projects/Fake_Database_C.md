## Fake Database
A Fake Database is a kind of "structure" or "array" that effectively use a C/C++ program where you made some conceptual rule to add and delete data from the database according to you.

```text

𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚𝐛𝐚𝐬𝐞:

  Index(for searching)
    ↓
    0|-----------|
     |           | ← Data Cell(Contain Data)
    1|-----------|
     |           |
    2|-----------|
     |           |
    3|-----------|
     |           |
    4|-----------|

𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚𝐛𝐚𝐬𝐞 𝐈𝐧𝐬𝐞𝐫𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: Add or insert data to the database.
𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚𝐛𝐚𝐬𝐞 𝐃𝐞𝐥𝐞𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: Remove or Delete data from the database.
𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚𝐛𝐚𝐬𝐞 𝐒𝐢𝐳𝐞: Is Expanded as per requirement. (𝗟𝗶𝗻𝗸𝗲𝗱 𝗟𝗶𝘀𝘁)
```

Now It totally depends on how you can implement this project but one thing keep in mind databases want accuracy and is unambiguous so make sure you think about edge case as well.

Try it with yourself and make a commit of your file with your name field along with the project name in the "project" directory.


<b>Example:</b> <i>suryapratap_fake_database.cpp</i>

## Implementation
You can implement it with any kind of language and any kind of Data structure but the best way to implement it is to use statical typed language and a Linked List data structure to improve the performance and speed of the program. You know about Data are not persisted in RAM for more time so save the data into files.

1. <b>Language:</b> C++ 
1. <b>Data Structure:</b> Linked List
1. <b>File Handling:</b> Real-Time File Handling
1. <b>Dashboard or Manu:</b> Required

> You can implement it with any programming language you are good at.
